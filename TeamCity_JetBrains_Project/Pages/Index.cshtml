        <div class="azuretext">
            Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience using Azure DevOps to manage code, automate builds, and
            streamline deployments. I learned how to create and configure CI/CD pipelines that automatically compile and test
            code with every commit, ensuring reliability and consistency. Azure DevOps also helped me understand how
            development teams collaborate through repositories, track progress with boards, and maintain efficient release cycles.
            These experiences reflect the same workflows and responsibilities found in real-world DevOps internships and
            entry-level engineering roles, where automation and teamwork are key to successful software delivery.

            <div class="wcutext">
                Automation is at the heart of modern DevOps practices. By building CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, I learned how automation reduces human error, speeds up deployment, and improves software reliability. Every push to the repository triggered automatic builds and tests, helping simulate real industry workflows that emphasize consistency and efficiency.

            <h4 class="wcuheader">Collaboration that Scales</h4>
            <div class="wcutext">
                DevOps is as much about people as it is about technology. Using Git and Azure DevOps Boards, I experienced firsthand how collaboration tools help teams stay aligned, track progress, and resolve issues efficiently. These practices reinforced the importance of communication, version control, and teamwork in professional development environments.

            <div class="wcutext">
                Through containerization with Docker, I learned how to create reproducible environments that eliminate the “it works on my machine” problem. This hands-on experience gave me a stronger understanding of how applications are tested, deployed, and maintained with consistency across local and cloud systems.

            <h4 class="wcuheader">From Code to Cloud</h4>
            <div class="wcutext">
                The journey from writing code to deploying a working product in the cloud taught me how interconnected every stage of DevOps is. I used the Azure Portal to deploy, monitor, and scale applications—connecting the dots between development and operations while gaining valuable experience in cloud-based management.

            <h4 class="wcuheader">Continuous Learning</h4>
            <div class="wcutext">
                DevOps isn’t just a set of tools—it’s a mindset of continuous improvement. Each project challenged me to streamline processes, adopt automation, and reflect on how to deliver better, faster, and more reliably. This approach mirrors what’s expected in real-world DevOps teams, where learning never stops.
