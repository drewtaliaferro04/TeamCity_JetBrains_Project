            Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience using Azure DevOps to manage code, automate builds, and
            streamline deployments. I learned how to create and configure CI/CD pipelines that automatically compile and test
            code with every commit, ensuring reliability and consistency. Azure DevOps also helped me understand how
            development teams collaborate through repositories, track progress with boards, and maintain efficient release cycles.
            These experiences reflect the same workflows and responsibilities found in real-world DevOps internships and
            entry-level engineering roles, where automation and teamwork are key to successful software delivery.
